# N-Queens Solver in Java

This project implements a **recursive backtracking solution** for the classic N-Queens problem using Java. It uses an object-oriented approach with a chessboard represented as a grid of `Node` objects containing `Piece` instances.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem

The N-Queens problem asks:  
> Can you place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other?

For an 8Ã—8 board, there are **92 distinct solutions**.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- âœ… Recursive backtracking
- âœ… Prints **all** valid solutions
- âœ… Uses a `Node[][]` structure for the chessboard
- âœ… Custom `Piece` and `PieceType` classes
- âœ… Clean console output
